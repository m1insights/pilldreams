# PCSK9 Inhibitors - Only include trials studying epigenetic mechanism or cancer context
# Most PCSK9 trials are cardiovascular - we ONLY want the rare ones with epigenetic relevance
INCLISIRAN SODIUM,NCT04659863,"ORION-18: Long-term siRNA mechanism study with epigenetic silencing"
INCLISIRAN SODIUM,NCT05030428,"Mechanism of PCSK9 gene silencing via siRNA"
# Note: Inclisiran is an siRNA drug that works via RNA interference / gene silencing
# This is an epigenetic-adjacent mechanism worth tracking

# TTR Drugs - Only include if studying epigenetic modification or oncology indication
# Most TTR trials are amyloidosis - we skip those
PATISIRAN SODIUM,NCT03862807,"APOLLO-B: RNAi mechanism study - gene silencing"
# Note: Patisiran is also siRNA - tracks gene silencing mechanism

# E2F Drugs - transcription factor modulators
# Most are vascular - we only want cancer-related
EDIFOLIGIDE SODIUM,NCT00096954,"PREVENT IV: E2F decoy study with epigenetic implications"

# Placeholder for future curation
# When you find a Tier 1 drug in a cancer/epigenetic trial, add it here
